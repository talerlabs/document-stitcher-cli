# Embedded PDF Test

This document references a local PDF that should be merged into the output. The asset is `./embeddable_fixture.pdf`.

Embedded PDF link:

![Local PDF](./embeddable_fixture.pdf)

If the file is missing the generator should warn and skip the embed (test will still pass if generator does not error).
